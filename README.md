## 🧾 About

This is my **first** project with NodeJs. This API was created to return the songs you are listening to on Spotify in real time

## 🔧 Tools

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org) 💚

## 👨‍💻 How to Setup

```bash
  # Clone the project
  $ git clone https://github.com/Davi-html/api-spotify-backend.git
```
```bash
  # Enter directory
  $ cd api-spotify-backend
```

```bash
  # Install the dependencies, if you use npm
  $ npm install
```

or

```bash
  # Install the dependencies, if you use yarn
  $ yarn
```

## How to use

For the API to work you need to create a **.env** file and add it to your **.gitignore** file so that it doesn't get pushed to your github and your data gets exposed

```bash 
# npm install dotenv
```

## .env

After creating the .env file you need to add
```bash 
# PORT=3000
# CLIENT_ID=your client id
# CLIENT_SECRET=your client secret
# REFRESH_TOKEN=your access token
```

```bash
  $ npm run dev
```
